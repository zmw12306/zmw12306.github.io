* I am currently a fourth-year PhD student at [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu), advised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/) since 2021. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.

* My research interests are Large Language Models (LLM) for software engineering, and traditional program analysis/software testing.
