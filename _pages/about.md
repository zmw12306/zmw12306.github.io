* I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof.[Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/) since 2021. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.

* My research interests are program analysis, software testing and formal methods.
