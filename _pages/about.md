I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu), advised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/) since 2021. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.

My research focuses on **improving software reliability and efficiency**. I build **LLM agents or program analysis tools to automate software development tasks such as code generation, software testing, and program repair**, with the broader goal of improving software correctness, robustness, and trustworthiness.

**P.S. I am actively seeking full-time industry roles starting in summer 2026. Please feel free to reach out if you think I’d be a good fit!**
